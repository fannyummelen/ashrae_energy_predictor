# ashrae energy predictor

For this project I competed in a Kaggle competetition (see external link). The goal of this competition was to predict the energy
consumption of several buildings for 2017 and 2018 based on their energy consumption in 2016 and weather data.  

## Quick start
* Download this project.
* Extract csv_input.zip file into the folder "csv_input" in the base of this project. 
* Install the packages listed under dependencies
* Run main.py for data visualization and model training
* Run predict_kaggle_energy.py to make predictions for the test set

Alternatively, you can open "config.json" and set "clean_data_from_scratch\enable" to "true" and to start with the raw data as can be downloaded from Kaggle.com (however it is a large data set so this will take quite some time). 

## Dependencies:

Pandas  
Numpy  
Sklearn  
Joblib  
Json  
Os  
Scipy  
Datetime  
Math  
Pyplot    
Seaborn
